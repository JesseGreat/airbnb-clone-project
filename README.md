- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews**.
- A **Review** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is associated with one **Booking**.


## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure authentication and role-based access, distinguishing between hosts and guests.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to list, update, and manage their properties. This feature includes adding property details such as location, price, and availability.

### Booking System
Provides guests with the ability to search for properties, check availability, and make bookings. Hosts can view and manage bookings for their properties.

### Review System
Allows users to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed at. This feature helps maintain transparency and improves the overall user experience.

### Payment Processing
Handles secure payment transactions for bookings. This feature ensures that payments are processed efficiently and provides status updates for each transaction.



## API Security

### Authentication
Authentication ensures that only legitimate users can access the system by verifying their identity through secure methods such as passwords or tokens. This is crucial for protecting user accounts and preventing unauthorized access.

### Authorization
Authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform based on their role (e.g., host or guest). This prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they do not own, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting restricts the number of API requests a user or client can make within a specific time frame. This helps prevent abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and ensures fair usage of system resources.

### Data Encryption
All sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest. This protects user data from being intercepted or accessed by malicious actors.

### Input Validation
Input validation ensures that all data sent to the API is properly sanitized and validated. This prevents common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), safeguarding the system from malicious inputs.

### Logging and Monitoring
Comprehensive logging and monitoring will be implemented to track API usage and detect suspicious activities. This allows for quick identification and response to potential security breaches.

Security is critical for protecting user data, securing payment transactions, and maintaining trust in the platform. By implementing these measures, the project ensures a safe and reliable experience for all users.


## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features and updates are delivered quickly and reliably while maintaining high-quality standards. CI/CD pipelines help reduce manual errors, improve collaboration, and accelerate the development lifecycle.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Jenkins** : Can be used for advanced pipeline configurations and integrations.
- **Kubernetes** : Manages containerized applications for scalability and reliability.

By implementing a CI/CD pipeline, the project ensures rapid delivery of updates, minimizes downtime, and maintains a seamless user experience.
